Welcome!, I'm a researcher working in the field of applying machine learning tools for scientific applications. I am currently a doctoral candidate in the [School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering](https://www.ceat.okstate.edu/mae) at Oklahoma State University (OSU). I work in the [KARA Lab](https://www.kursatkara.com) under the mentorship of Dr. Kursat Kara. 

I am a **_Roy Virginia Dorrough Graduate Fellow_**, **_Vice-President_** of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Graduate Student Association at OSU and an ex- **_Visiting Researcher_** at [Palo Alto Research Center](https://www.parc.com). 

My research entails Scientific Machine Learning for Computational Fluid Dynamics applications with major focus on Reduced Order Modeling using Machine Learning for Unmanned Aerial Systems in Urban air spaces. I also have a specialisation in Unmanned Aerial Systems during my Ph.D. and Masters in Computational Fluid Dynamics from North Carolina State University, Raleigh. My academic work has been [published](publications) in various conferences like AIAA Scitech/Aviation, AMS, APS-DFD, SIAM and journals. I have a Level 1 High Powered Rocketry certification and enjoy hiking!.
