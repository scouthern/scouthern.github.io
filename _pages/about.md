Hello, I'm a graduate research assistant working in aerospace engingineering psychology for Unmanned Aerial Systems  and General Aviation pilots. I am a masters student in the [School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering](https://ceat.okstate.edu/mae) at Oklahoma State University (OSU). I work in the [AEON Lab](https://aeon.nicolettafala.com/) under the advisement of Dr. Nicoletta Fala. 

I led the Oklahoma State University [Argonia Cup](http://www.argoniacup.com/) Senior Design team to victory in 2021. I was a research assistant for [OCAST](https://oklahoma.gov/ocast.html) project and funded through an Undergraduate Research Scholarship.
