permalink: /publication/24/09/2019-Optimization of Membrane Electrode Assembly of PEM Fuel Cell by Response Surface Method
excerpt: 'The membrane electrode assembly (MEA) plays an important role in the proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) performance. Typically, the structure comprises of a polymer electrolyte membrane sandwiched by agglomerate catalyst layers at the anode and cathode. Optimization of various parameters in the design of MEA is, thus, essential for reducing cost and material usage, while improving cell performance. In this paper, optimization of MEA is performed using a validated two-phase PEMFC numerical model. Key MEA parameters affecting the performance of a single PEMFC are determined from sensitivity analysis and are optimized using the response surface method (RSM). The optimization is carried out at two different operating voltages. The results show that membrane thickness and membrane protonic conductivity coefficient are the most significant parameters influencing cell performance.'
